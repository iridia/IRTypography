# IRTypography

Tiny methods that should help when dealing with Core Text.  Written when using Omni Frameworks for the iPad.  Contains code that does these:

* gives you a bounding UIBezierPath for a range in a large attributed string containing a particular attribute
* lets you define transformers and hop between persisted and presentable states of attributed strings
* makes working with text attachments, especially invoking bound actions to a range in the attributed string, a lot more easier
* allows blocks-based CTLineRef and CTRunRef enumeration within a particular frame

This pile of code was written some six months ago against iOS 4.3.  It might be na√Øve, or even relatively untested for cases that are not in the particular application against whose codebase the mini-framework is created.  Some of them could even go away, if substitutes are found in colossal Omni frameworks.

This framework relies upon `IRFoundations` and the Omni frameworks.  To create an app, simply link them all.  To create some static library, use weak linking.
